# HooBank-JSM-Remake

This is a project made with JavaScript Mastery's guidance. Find it on https://youtu.be/_oO4Qi5aVZs.

I learned a lot about Tailwind CSS and I definetly will keep building projects with it. Excellent tool!

I will branch this project into SolarSourced. A solar energy utilization business idea.

Then, I will branch again into a template and add comments.
